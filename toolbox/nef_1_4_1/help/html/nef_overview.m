%% NEF description
%
% NEF is framework designed for nonlinear state estimation of
% discrete dynamical systems. The aim of this framework is to facilitate
% implementation, testing and use of various nonlinear state estimation
% methods. The main strength of the framework is its versatility due to the
% possibility of either structural or probabilistic description of the
% problem. As the toolbox is designed on the object oriented basis, further
% adding of user-specified nonlinear estimation algorithms is extremely
% easy.

%%
%  The following picture demonstrates the task for which the NEF was
%  designed.

% 

%%
% The basic tasks that the NEF supports are basicaly these
%
% * description and simulation of a plant/model,
% * estimation of the state of the model,
% * providing estimates in terms of probability density
% functions.

%%
% The most outstanding features of the framework are
%
% * highly modular and extensible
% * designed with support for natural description of the problem in mind
% (both structural and probailistic description of generaly time-varying
% systems) 
% * fast and easy estimation experiment setup
% * facilitates implementation of filtering, prediction and smoothing tasks
% * implements many of the popular nonlinear state estimators

%%
% The framework itself is divided into several modules each responsible for
% one task of the estimation experiment desing. The main modules are
%
% * modeling componend - used for describing the model including
% description of time varying random variables and time-varying nonlinear
% functions
% * estimation component - provides many well known estimators and mean for
% simple performace of all the basig estimation task
% * performance evalutors component - offers function for omputing popular
% performace measures

% Details concerning the individual components will be presented in
% separate part of this document.

%% System requirements
