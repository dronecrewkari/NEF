ver. 1.4.1			3.1.2017
    * added measurement difference autocovariance method implementation (nefMDA) for identification 
      of noise covariance matrices

ver. 1.4.0			6.11.2015
    * added autocovariance least-squares method implementation (nefALS) for identification 
      of noise covariance matrices

ver. 1.3.1			29.11.2013
    * various fixes and enhancements concernig the use of toolbox for control purposes
    
ver. 1.3.0			14.10.2013
    * implemented Stochastic Integration Filter (nefSIF)
    * the whole toolbox was more optimized for speed bringing about up 2x speedup
    * corrected issue with new MATLAB version regarding cell array with one zero dimension
    * it is possible to use square-root version of the local filters as local filters in nefGSM
    * needs at least MATLAB R2009b
        
ver. 1.2.0			Jul 23, 2010
    * added two new estimators nefSDD2 (numerically stable version of nefDD2)
     and nefEnKF (ensemble Kalman filter)
    * nefUKF, nefSUKF, nefDD1, nefDD2, nefSDD1, nefSDD2 support adaptive
     choice of parameter
    * nefGSM and nefItKalman can use all the local filters as base
    * added help into class files for all the estimators
    * added first version of documentation to the documentation browser
    * corrected scripts addNEFPath and rmNEFPath to work flawlessly on all
     platforms supported by MATLAB

ver. 1.1.0			Mar 19, 2010
    * added performance evaluators (for example of their use see example13)
    * estimator constructors reports use of default values

ver. 1.0.2			Mar 19, 2010
    * removed cause of possible MATLAB crash after calling just clear all between two examples
    * nefGSM estimator can now work with nefPDFSystem

ver. 1.0.1			Mar 12, 2010
    * stabilized nefPF algorithm (scaling weights for proper normalization)
    * added evalLogPDF to nefGaussianRV
    * replaced the likelihood and transPDF by logLikelihood and logTransPDF in nefEqSystem
    * added some checks of the noises to nefEqSystem
    * removed critical bug in PF preventing resampling from being executed in some cases
    * added optimalized code for additive systems in all derivative free filters
    * removed bug in nefUDKalman when the prediction was not properly updated for all measurement elements
    * nefUD completely rewritten and renamed to nefUDKalman
    * added nefSKalman implementing Square-root Kalman filter
    * nefItFilter and nefGSM can use any of the local filters

1.0.0				Jul 14, 2009 
    * initial public release
    * stabilized API of the new framework
